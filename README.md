# Scope changes
Oh boy, so in short this will no longer act as an all-in-one DAQ tool, why? Because there is no need for me to re-invent that wheel, instead what this app will do is act as a bridge to the foxglove websocket and save data as MCAP files

# Timeline
It can read a serial port and parse it, and thats about it, thankfully not needing to do any processing in this app will make the last bit of this stupid easy
