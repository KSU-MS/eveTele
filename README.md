# Scope changes part ??? : idek
We went from 100% rust to 100% python in one commit so that is something. This is mostly to speed up dev time and actually get something working instead of fixing other peoples crates for weeks at a time because no one wants to use rust for CAN parsing or something idk.

# Timeline
Have some tool working by the 26th to show to the team and get feed back on what they want to use.

# Ignorance
It is what this project is soley defined by at this point but we ball or something like that
